# Sign_Language_Detection

**Overview**

1.This project focuses on detecting and recognizing sign language gestures using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The model is trained to classify hand signs into predefined categories, enabling real-time sign language interpretation.

**Features**

1.Deep Learning-based Model: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate gesture recognition.

2.Real-time Detection: Supports live video feed input for dynamic sign recognition.

3.Pre-trained Model Usage: Can leverage transfer learning for improved performance.

4.Dataset: Uses a labeled dataset of hand gestures for training and evaluation.

5.Interactive Interface: Integrates with Gradio for user-friendly interaction.


**Installation**

1.Clone the repository:
_*.git clone <repository_url>
*.>cd Sign_Language_Detection_

2.Install dependencies:
_*pip install -r requirements.txt_

3.Launch Jupyter Notebook:
_*.jupyter notebook_


**Dataset**

1.The model is trained on a dataset containing images of various hand signs.

2.Images are preprocessed and augmented to improve model robustness.


**Model Architecture**

1.Feature Extraction: CNN layers extract spatial features from input images.

2.Classification: Fully connected layers classify signs into categories.

3.Optimization: Uses techniques like Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.


**Usage**

1.Run the notebook to train or evaluate the model.

2.For real-time detection, execute the script that captures live video feed.

3.Use Gradio for an interactive web-based interface.

**Results**

1.The model achieves high accuracy on test data.
2.Provides real-time recognition with minimal latency.


**Future Enhancements**

1.Improve accuracy with more training data.

2.Deploy as a web app for broader accessibility
.
3.Integrate with NLP for sign-to-text conversion.
